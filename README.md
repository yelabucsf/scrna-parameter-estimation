`memento` is a Python package for estimating the mean, variability, and gene correlation from scRNA-seq data as well as contructing a framework for hypothesis testing of differences in these parameters between groups of cells. Method-of-moments estimators are used for parameter estimation, and efficient resampling is used to construct confidence intervals and establish statistical significance.
