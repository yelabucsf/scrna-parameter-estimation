Welcome to mementoâ€™s documentation!
====================================================

``memento`` is a python package for performing differential mean, variability, and correlation in single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our paper can be found at "Method of moments framework for differential expression analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data."

Some current limitations include:
- continous covariates, such as cell state variables
- non-linear representations of covariates 

**Installation**
